                        <p>Early Years: I was born in Delta into a family of 8 at the time, later I gained a younger brother. I had a wonderful childhood where I where I loved to play in our willow tree, build forts, and just spend time that was meaningful with my family. I had the great opportunity to have 4 older sisters who I could play with and who dressed me up and made me feel pretty. I attended school at the North Elementary School and had many great teachers. One of my favorites teachers was Mrs. Anderson who loved and cared for all kids in her class. I spent most of my days learning to play the piano, and playing with my older sister and younger brother.</p>
                        <p>Teenage Years: During this years I gained new friends that I still am friends with and had many meaningful interactions with them. I attended middle school for the first part of my teenage years where I learned to play the violin. My favorite class in school was P.E. because we played dodgeball. In sixth grade when walking to school, I slipped on ice and cut my hand open and to this day I still have the scare that it created on my hand. As I went into high school I was forced into picking a sport to play by my mother. I decided on Tennis which I hed never before played. I found enjoyment in the sport and spent most of my time practicing and playing it with anyone that I could. Becasue of all of my practice I was able to become the top player on my team and played as the #1 singles player. I worked hard and took region my sophmore and senior or high school and took 2nd place as a junior. Outside of tennis and school I spent most of my time with family and friends whether that was going to sporting events or playing games it did not really matter. I was just happy to spend time with them. I graduated at 18 years old and had been accepted to Brigham Young University for the fall of 2019. </p>
                        <p>Early 20's: During this time I have been attending Brigham Young University and have had so many fun anc exciting experiences. During my second semester of college COVID hit and so I finished my first year at BYU online. The next year was also spent online but I was able to return again in 2021. That fall I met a friend who later set me up with her cousin whom I got married to. I got married in August of 2022 which has been such a great blessing. I then had a little boy named Grant who was unfortunately a stillbirth but whom I have learned so much from. So far, I have had a great life and have look forward to the rest of it!</p>
